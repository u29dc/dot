# Compose References Index

Load selectively to keep context minimal.

- `anti-patterns.md`: failure catalog with detection + remediation mapping. Load for audits and migration diagnosis.
- `ecosystem-design.md`: cross-tool invariants, onboarding checklist, and release safety rules. Load for multi-tool architecture or new tool onboarding.

Suggested order:

1. `anti-patterns.md` first when debugging failures.
2. `ecosystem-design.md` second when designing/standardizing the ecosystem surface.
